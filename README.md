# Hurricane and Typhoon Data Analysis and Exploration

In this data exploration, historical hurricane and typhoon data from 1850 to 2015 is analyzed to identify trends and patterns that could be helpful in future prediction efforts. Analyzing the historical data here has unvcovered hidden insights on the correlation between maximum wind, minimum pressure, storm classification, and storm frequency according to time. In addition, various maps and animations provide insight on the behavior of the storms. As a future exercise, some machine learning efforts will be useful to predict not just future storm occurences and frequencies, but also storm severity as well.
